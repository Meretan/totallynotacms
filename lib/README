This directory contains libraries maintained elsewhere.  If you decide to
change them, be sure to submit your changes upstream (at least try to do
so).

However, makefiles in this project assume libraries never change and hence
don't look for their dependencies: if a libray file exists, that library
doesn't get rebuilt automatically.
